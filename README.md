This web-based application is designed to streamline ABC Hospital’s appointment process. This system allows patients to book appointments online, doctors to manage their schedules, and receptionists to track appointments efficiently. The system includes a user-friendly welcome page, an admin login for managing doctors, receptionists, and appointments, admin-only doctor registration, online appointment scheduling, viewable appointment lists for doctors, receptionists, and patients, and a dedicated doctor login for managing schedules, all built using HTML, PHP, and MySQL, and can be hosted locally with either Laragon or XAMPP. This system aims to enhance efficiency and modernize ABC Hospital’s appointment management.
