These are the passwords For Each Login


	Admin  		- Username- admin		Password- admin123

	Doctor 		- Username- doc			Password- doc123

***NOTE***

Please Do Not Open Any (Edit or Delete) Files because it will always show an Error Even Though Those Functions Work Properly


Also Once you open "view all appointments" page you will only be able to see Appointments that already exist within the database, You will Have to open "add appointment" page and add your own details, once you have finished adding your appointment throught "add appointment" page revisit "view all appointments" page and you should be able to see the appointment you just made
